# Pytrack
### Low Cost, Open Source Object Tracking on Raspberry Pi

This repository contains work from the Open Tracking (CS Capstone 32) group, specifically Pytrack.  Pytrack uses a Raspberry Pi, camera, and DC motors to easily and cheaply track faces.  

To run an example of facial detection, run `python src/face_detect.py cascade/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`.
